**pyrandonaut** interfaces with a QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator) where it gets a list of
`quantum
random <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator#Quantum_random_properties>`__
numbers, converts them to coordinates and then computes the `gaussian
kernel density
estimate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation>`__ of
those coordinates to find a point with a statistically anomalous
density, similar to how an Attractor point is generated by the
`Randonautica <https://www.randonautica.com/>`__ app.

This gives you the ability to implement quantum random coordinates in your own
applications. Just ``import pyrandonaut`` and off you go!

If you're unfamiliar with Randonautica, the concepts of Probability Blind-Spots
and Quantum Randomness, I recommend reading
`fatum_theory.txt <https://github.com/anonyhoney/fatum-en/blob/master/docs/fatum_theory.txt>`__
which shipped with the original Fatum Project bot that inspired
Randonautica.
`This video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6aXta3m1M>`__ gives a lot of
great background info too.

If you have no idea what any of this is about
and is completely new to this, watch `this
video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDX81AUm8yE>`__ and/or read `this
article <https://medium.com/swlh/randonauts-how-a-random-number-generator-can-set-you-free-dfc2a2413e15>`__.
