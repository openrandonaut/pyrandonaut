Visualization
=============

This is a heatmap visualization of how the module calculates the
Attractor point. An arbitrary number of points based on QRNG numbers are
plotted geospatially and the place with the highest density of points is
returned. Image made using
`Seaborn <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn>`__ and `this
script <https://github.com/openrandonaut/openrandonaut/blob/main/kdeplot_heatmap.py>`__
